OgmoPipelineExtensions
===

This a sort of fork of the [endy/OgmoXNA](https://github.com/endy/OgmoXNA) project, which in turn is a fork of the original version by the [Dead Pixel Society](http://ogmoxna.codeplex.com/)

I am slowly updating this to handle the latest version of the OGMO editor, which at the time of writing is `2.1.0.6`

Original project(s) description:

OgmoXNA is an XNA 3.1 Game Library and set of Content Pipeline Extensions for Maddy Thorson's multi-platform [Ogmo Editor](http://www.ogmoeditor.com/).

Its goal is to provide neutral, consumable objects that you can use to to load your levels without having to follow a game design that isn't yours.

Support the awesome Ogmo Editor by Matt Thorson which this library is built for! Visit [http://www.ogmoeditor.com](http://www.ogmoeditor.com), and if you find it useful please donate to Matt to keep the project going.

Preliminary documentation is available at the Documentation link above.

Full source code for the OgmoXNA library, content pipeline extensions, and a demo platform game, as well as the release binaries of each are available at the Downloads link above.

Please let me know of any bugs or improvements to the code base, or if you just need help with getting started by using the Discussions link above."
